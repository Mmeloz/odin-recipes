    <h3>Description</h3>
    
    <p>         Its a creamy tomato-based sauce that starts off with cooking down some onions and garlic. 
        Then tomato paste is caramelized in olive oil and heavy cream is added to turn it into a beautifully smooth sauce. 
        And if that didnt sound good enough, the final touches are butter, tons of freshly grated parmesan, and some pasta water. </p>
    
    <p>        Red pepper flakes spice it up while the basil brings a fresh herbal touch to the whole dish.
        Its truly perfection and my new favorite pasta dish to make.</p>
    
    <h3>Ingredients</h3>
    <ul>
        <li>Extra virgin oil</li>
        <li>Garlic</li>
        <li>Tomato paste</li>
        <li>Heavy cream</li>
        <li>Red pepper flakes</li>
        <li>Parmesan</li>
        <li>Salt and black pepper</li>
        <li>Pasta water</li>
        <li>Rigatoni</li>
    </ul>
    <h3>Steps</h3>

    <ol>
        <li>Bring a large pot of salted water to a boil. Throw in the pasta and cook according to package directions. Reserve at least 1 cup of pasta water and then drain.</li>
        <li>In a saucepan, add the olive oil over medium heat. Add the garlic and tomato paste and cook for about 4 to 5 minutes. The tomato paste will darken in color from a bright red to reddish brown. This process removes acidity from the tomato paste.</li>
        <li>Add heavy cream and mix until incorporated. Simmer for about 2 to 3 minutes.</li>
        <li>Add the red pepper flakes, dried basil, salt, and black pepper to taste. Mix again.</li>
        <li>Add the grated parmesan, butter, and 1/2 a cup pasta water. Mix until the sauce is smooth and creamy. If you think it needs more pasta water, you can add but 1/2 a cup is perfect for me.</li>
        <li>Toss in the cooked pasta and mix to coat evenly. Optional, top it off with more grated parm, chopped parsley, and chili flakes.</li>
    </ol>
