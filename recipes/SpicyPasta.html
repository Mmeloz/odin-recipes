    <h3>The Gigi Hadid Pasta is nothing new, in fact it originated in Italy and is more commonly known as Spicy Vodka Pasta. </h3>
    
    <p>         Its a creamy tomato-based sauce that starts off with cooking down some onions and garlic. 
        Then tomato paste is caramelized in olive oil and heavy cream is added to turn it into a beautifully smooth sauce. 
        And if that didnt sound good enough, the final touches are butter, tons of freshly grated parmesan, and some pasta water. </p>
    
    <p>        Red pepper flakes spice it up while the basil brings a fresh herbal touch to the whole dish.
        Its truly perfection and my new favorite pasta dish to make.</p>
